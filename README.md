Eastern Cascades Forest-Snow Observations 2022-2023

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Processed Camera Data** - Daily snow depth measured using 5cm increments on 3 poles at each of 12 sites, fractional forest snow cover area, and canopy 
                        snow presence all extracted from daily time-lapse images.  
                        
**Snow Disappearance Date and Gap Fraction** - Snow Disappearance Date calculated using camera data or ground temperature sensors and canopy gap fraction 
                        calculated as a percentage of total pixels in a hemispherical image which are sky. 
                        
**Cleaned Temprature Data** -  Time series of temprature data recorded by 10 HOBO sensors at each site (9 placed ground level and one in a tree measuring 
                        air temperature).

## **List of abbreviations/headers**

**CN:**		Cle Elum North

**CS:**		Cle Elum South 

**Site:**		Refers to the ridge aspect (North or South)

**Plot:**		Refers to the individual 10m x 10m grids, which are labeled by basal area factor

**Position:**	Refers to the location within a plot. A numerical value refers to the position of a temprature sensor, pole values such as "pole1" refers to 
          the position of a pole
          
**LocationID:**	Identifier including site, plot, and position. For instance, CN-20-1 refers to stake 1 at the Cle Elum North ridge site with a basal area factor 
            of 20 and CN-20-pole1 refers to pole 1 at this same site. 
            
**LocID:**		Identifier including site, plot, and CamID used in timelapse camera processing.

**BAF:**		Basal area factor

**CamID:**		Camera ID: unique to each camera (typically camera model and a number)

**Zopudate:**	Date recorded by ZOPU camera 

**Zoputime:**	Time recorded by ZOPU camera

**Garddate:**	Date recorded by GARD camera

**Gardtime:**	Time recorded by GARD camera

**Pole1obs:**	Snow depth measured relative to half-meter marks 

**Pole1:**		Snow depth adjusted for how much of the pole is underground 

**FSCA:**		Fractional snow cover area: refers to the area of the 10x10 plot that is covered with snow (measured with visual best esimate)

**Canopy_snow:**	Recorded as a y/n value for presence of snow in the canopy (measured with visual best esimate)

**median_gapf:**	The median gap fraction value taken from all the gap fractions calculated for each individual LocationID   

**min_gapf:**	The minimum gap fraction value taken from all the gap fractions calculated for each individual LocationID  

**max_gapf:**	The maximum gap fraction value taken from all the gap fractions calculated for each individual LocationID  

**SDD:**		Snow disapearance date

**SDD1:**		First snow disappearance date (SDD2 is second, SDD3 is third, etc.)

**CN201_temp:**	This example would describe time series temperature data recorded by sensor at site CN, Plot 20, Position 1

**CN20A_temp:**	This example would describe time series air temperature data recorded by sensor at site CN, Plot 20
